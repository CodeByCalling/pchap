### **1\. Introduction** {#1.-introduction}

#### 1.1 Purpose of This Document {#1.1-purpose-of-this-document}

This document serves as the official policy manual for the Pastor’s Care Health Assistance Program (PCHAP) Version 3.0. It outlines the objectives, eligibility, contributions, benefits structure, administrative processes, and compliance guidelines necessary for the effective implementation of the program. It is designed to inform members, contributors, and administrators of their roles and responsibilities, as well as the operating principles that govern the fund.

This version consolidates the lessons from previous versions and reflects updated legal and governance safeguards, preparing the program for official launch under the J29 Corporation framework.

#### 1.2 Background and Rationale {#1.2-background-and-rationale}

The PCHAP was initiated as a compassionate response to the growing medical and financial needs of pastors, full-time workers, and lay leaders within the Jesus Reigns Ministries (JRM) network. Recognizing that many church workers face personal and family health emergencies with limited financial capacity, PCHAP aims to provide structured, mutual assistance rooted in biblical principles of generosity, care, and stewardship.

The program is not an insurance product. It is a community-based, voluntary contribution system through which members support one another in times of need, with aid given based on the availability of funds.

#### 1.3 Statement of the Program’s Nature {#1.3-statement-of-the-program’s-nature}

PCHAP is a non-stock, non-profit, faith-based mutual aid program that operates to provide medical, hospitalization, and funeral assistance to eligible members. It is governed by the principles of shared responsibility, transparency, and stewardship.

All benefits under the program are subject to fund availability and board approval. There are no guaranteed claims, no insurance contracts, and no individual entitlements.

#### 1.4 Legal Basis and Compliance {#1.4-legal-basis-and-compliance}

The program is administered under the legal entity of J29 Corporation, a non-stock, non-profit corporation duly registered with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC).

PCHAP is not subject to regulation by the Insurance Commission of the Philippines, as it avoids the characteristics defined under:

* Republic Act No. 10607 (The Insurance Code of the Philippines): This law governs entities that provide guaranteed risk coverage in exchange for premium payments. PCHAP does not offer guaranteed benefits and collects contributions for mutual assistance only.  
* Republic Act No. 9829 (The Pre-Need Code of the Philippines): This law regulates companies that collect advance payments for future guaranteed services. PCHAP does not fall under this category, as it provides aid only when funds are available and does not offer guaranteed future services.

A clear legal disclaimer is included in this document and will be signed by each member during registration to affirm that they understand the non-insurance nature of the program.

---

### **2\. Organizational Framework** {#2.-organizational-framework}

#### 2.1 Legal Entity {#2.1-legal-entity}

The Pastor’s Care Health Assistance Program (PCHAP) operates under J29 Corporation, a duly registered non-stock, non-profit organization with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) of the Philippines.

J29 Corporation shall serve as the official legal and administrative body responsible for overseeing all operations, compliance, and governance matters related to PCHAP.

#### 2.2 Governance and Oversight {#2.2-governance-and-oversight}

PCHAP shall be governed by a Board of Trustees, appointed in accordance with the updated Articles of Incorporation and Bylaws of J29 Corporation. The Board shall have full authority to:

* Approve program policies and guidelines  
* Oversee fund management and disbursement  
* Ensure legal and regulatory compliance  
* Approve member assistance applications based on fund availability

#### 2.3 Administrative Structure {#2.3-administrative-structure}

An Administrative Oversight Team shall be designated to manage day-to-day operations, including:

* Membership registration and records  
* Collection tracking and monitoring  
* Processing of assistance applications and documentation  
* Communication and reporting to members

#### 2.4 Financial Management {#2.4-financial-management}

All contributions collected under PCHAP will be pooled into a single benevolent fund managed by J29 Corporation. Financial transactions, fund balances, and assistance disbursements shall be recorded, reported quarterly, and subject to internal review by the Board.

There will be no individual member accounts and no benefit guarantees. The fund is not intended for investment or profit but is to be used solely for the purpose of assisting eligible members in times of need.

#### 2.5 Reporting and Transparency {#2.5-reporting-and-transparency}

The Administrative Oversight Team will submit quarterly financial reports to the Board of Trustees and provide summary updates to all members. These reports shall include:

* Total contributions received  
* Total disbursements granted  
* Remaining balance and obligations

This transparency ensures responsible stewardship and builds trust among the contributing members.

### **11\. Operational Structure and Legal Entity** {#11.-operational-structure-and-legal-entity}

The Pastor’s Care Health Assistance Program (PCHAP) is a mission-driven initiative established to support the medical and health-related needs of full-time workers, pastors, and leaders within Jesus Reigns Ministries (JRM).

To ensure legal compliance, proper fund administration, and structural sustainability, the program is operated under J29 Foundation, Inc., a separate non-stock, non-profit legal entity registered with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC).

While J29 provides the legal and administrative framework for PCHAP, the program remains a ministry initiative aligned with the mission and vision of JRM.

The partnership between JRM and J29 shall be guided by a Memorandum of Agreement (MOA), which will include:  
• Recognition of PCHAP as a program established to serve JRM workers  
• Regular reporting and financial transparency to the JRM Board of Trustees  
• Representation of JRM-appointed leaders or BOT members within the J29 Board  
• Provisions for accountability and realignment, should the direction of the program drift from its original purpose

This partnership ensures that PCHAP upholds both legal integrity and spiritual alignment while serving the JRM community.

### **12\. Policy Supremacy and Interpretation** {#12.-policy-supremacy-and-interpretation}

This policy document shall serve as the official and governing reference for all matters related to the Pastor’s Care Health Assistance Program (PCHAP).  
In the event of a conflict or inconsistency between this policy and any previous announcements, brochures, forms, or documents, this policy shall prevail.

Supplementary provisions or conditions stated in earlier or external documents that do not conflict with this policy may be upheld, subject to review and approval by the Board of Trustees.

Below are the 12 most important and commonly asked questions regarding the Pastor’s Care Health Assistance Program (PCHAP):

**1\. Is PCHAP an insurance product?**  
No. PCHAP is *not* an insurance plan and is *not regulated* by the Insurance Commission of the Philippines. It is a faith-based, mutual aid program under a non-stock, non-profit corporation (J29 Corporation), designed to provide voluntary assistance to members based on the availability of funds and board approval.

**2\. Are the benefits guaranteed?**  
No. All assistance is subject to fund availability and the approval of the Board of Trustees. While PCHAP provides estimated or projected amounts based on membership size, no benefit is promised or guaranteed.

**3\. Why do I need to sign a waiver and disclosure statement?**  
The waiver ensures that members understand the non-insurance nature of the program. By signing, you confirm that you acknowledge:

* Assistance is not guaranteed  
* PCHAP is not legally liable for any unfulfilled requests  
* Contributions are non-refundable  
* The program is subject to board discretion and available funds

**4\. What is the Pastor’s Care Health Assistance Program (PCHAP)?**  
PCHAP is a voluntary, community-based financial assistance program for pastors, full-time workers, and lay leaders within Jesus Reigns Ministries. It is designed to support qualified members during medical emergencies or in cases of bereavement—funded solely by member contributions and managed by J29 Corporation.

**5\. How much do I need to contribute monthly?**  
Each active member is expected to contribute ₱500 per month. This contribution must be consistent and up-to-date for members to remain eligible for assistance.

Eligible members may apply for:

* Medical or hospitalization aid (e.g., surgery, confinement, outpatient treatment)

* Bereavement/funeral assistance (voluntary-based aid upon board discretion)

**7\. What is the waiting period before I can request assistance?**  
You must complete six (6) continuous months of contributions before you become eligible to apply for any form of assistance. This ensures that the program has sufficient funds and fairness for all members.

**8\. What happens if I miss my monthly contributions?**

**9\. Are contributions refundable if I withdraw or do not receive assistance?**  
No. All contributions made to PCHAP are non-refundable and non-transferable, regardless of whether you eventually request or receive aid.

**10\. Are spouses and children also covered?**  
Yes. Spouses are eligible to join for the same ₱500 monthly contribution. Children under **18 years old** may be listed under a parent’s membership. Children **18 years and older** must apply separately if they meet eligibility criteria (e.g., are FTWs or lay pastors)

**11\. Are retirees eligible to join PCHAP?**  
Yes. Retired pastors, full-time workers (FTWs), and lay leaders of Jesus Reigns Ministries are eligible to join PCHAP.They must meet the same membership and contribution requirements as active members, including the ₱500 monthly contribution and the six (6) continuous monthly contributions before becoming eligible to request assistance.​
